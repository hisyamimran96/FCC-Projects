# FCC - Data Analysis with Python Certificate

## Content
5 Projects I built as part of the completion requirements for the course.

## Overview
In the Data Analysis with Python Certification, I learnt the fundamentals of data analysis with Python i.e. how to read data from sources like CSVs and Databases, processing and cleaning the data, and how to use libraries like Numpy, Pandas, Matplotlib, and Seaborn to visualize data. 

The completion of these 5 projects certified me with the Developer Certification, representing approximately 400 hours of coursework.
