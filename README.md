# FreeCodeCamp - Projects

## Contents

These are the archive for all my project assignments as part of the requirements to receive completion certificates for <a href = "https://www.freecodecamp.org/learn">FreeCodeCamp</a> courses. Each folder contains all the codes for projects of the respective course. 

I also included my certifications of completion for each courses inside the repo.
