# FCC - Scientific Computing with Python Certificate

## Content
5 Projects I built as part of the completion requirements for the course.

## Overview
In the Scientific Computing with Python Certification, I learnt Python fundamentals like variables, 
loops, conditionals, and functions. Then ramped up to complex data structures, networking, relational databases, and data visualization.

The courses were created by Dr. Charles Severance (also known as Dr. Chuck). He is a Clinical Professor at the University of Michigan School of Information, 
where he teaches various technology-oriented courses including programming, database design, and web development.
