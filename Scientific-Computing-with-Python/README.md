# FCC - Scientific Computing with Python Certificate

## Content
5 Projects I built as part of the completion requirements for the course.

## Overview
In the Scientific Computing with Python Certification, I learnt Python fundamentals like variables, 
loops, conditionals, functions and Object Oriented Programming. Then ramped up to complex data structures, networking, relational databases, and data visualization. 
This course completion certification is a developer certification representing 300 hours of coursework.

The courses were created by Dr. Charles Severance (also known as Dr. Chuck). He is a Clinical Professor at the University of Michigan School of Information, 
where he teaches various technology-oriented courses including programming, database design, and web development.
